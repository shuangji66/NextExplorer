/**
 * A settings write that sends part of a section, or sends a field in the wrong
 * shape.
 *
 * The settings page sends what changed, not the whole document, so the route
 * merges each section over what is stored. And it drops a field that is not in
 * the shape the field takes before anything is stored — which matters more than
 * it looks, because the service underneath repairs a bad value by putting the
 * *default* in its place. Without the route's check, a trash retention of
 * ninety days sent back as "forever" becomes thirty, and an access rule list
 * sent as anything other than a list becomes no rules at all: every folder an
 * administrator had hidden, visible again.
 *
 * So every case here first stores a value that differs from the default, then
 * sends the bad one, then reads back — a test that started from the default
 * could not tell the route's refusal from the service's repair.
 *
 * Who may write which section is pinned in `settings-write-boundary.test.js`.
